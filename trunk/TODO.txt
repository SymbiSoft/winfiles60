ALREADY DONE:

- input system partially rewritten for touch support and better key management

GRAPHICS:

- ridefinire dimensioni di ogni elemento. Tempo fa Dav91 mi aveva passato un documento con una sua idea. Prendere spunto da li.
- nel menu (per esempio) prendere la dimensione dell'immagine di selezioni. Tramite la funzione di text(coordinate rettangolo img) disegnare il testo (adattamento perfetto).

MAIN GOALS:

- IMAGE VIEWER: works only if the image is corrupted (it is the same of a normal image, but the image contains error code)
- !! resolution callback !! (Split with the 2nd ed. system???)
- akntextutils: new module in C++ like the old but with support to every font and ported to 3rd ed. Or another module in pure python (slower)
- new text stream (lines in a text viewer or note popup) object: it should adapt line spacing (height) for every resolution and aspect
- split WinFile in modules, like graphics, ui, utils, viewers, ...
- adapt every coordinate of text, menus etc... for every resolution (some objects are already ready)
- rewrite skin management (see the draft .py)
- SEarch for TODO: in the source....It can be a surprise!

OTHER:

- rewrite plugin system: every startup check for plugins (and their attributes). Possibility to manage them, have informations, disable, uninstall, settings (not only when plugin is running). PLugins also for the whole program (i.e: new menu functions...), image, text, audio formats...(some draft already written, src\plugins)
- improve file copy: the system works quite good but doesn't ask to overwrite ecc...
- improve file delete: check if read-only
- check translations, improve plugin translations
- new update system: check every core file for an update. Check and ask user which version with his changelog, warn about betas...
Permit updates also if not main release (warning user about these betas). (System based on revision n°?) [idea from Rigs Of Rods]
- use EYED3 for mp3 management to support id3v2 too
- add support to different time zones to correct some time/date calculation bugs
- end the screenshot feature
- test and place in menu the backlight feature
- mail system in 3rd ed?? Caps??

IDEAS:

- multiple windows/tabs
- menu and other popups should have a separate "panel" image blit on the canvas every refresh to simplify the management during i.e. continuos canvas refresh.

Small issues:

- winfile seem frozen opening a protected dir, unavailable etc..Show a popup and avoid to CD in that directory


For other issues, see the tab in google code!
